\section{About Me}

I am a happy parent, my son is 30 years younger than me, he is
my main responsibility right now, the most important thing is
to be an empathetic human being, starting with self care and
to put in to service for everyone the actions, thoughts and
opportunities.

By default I trust people, with care in order to make things
easier.  The truth is key for understanding.

I would like to live in Colombia at least three 7 years more
at least, there are plenty of actions to be made in my 
country, this is why I have decided to move away from Bogot√°
and share with others what I have learned and learn from others
to make a more sustainable environment.
