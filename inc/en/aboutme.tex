\section{About Me}

I am a happy parent, my son is 30 years younger than me, he is
my main responsibility right now, the most important thing is
to be an empathetic human being, starting with self care and
to put in to service for everyone the thoughts, actions and
to understand that contexts differ for everyone.

By default I trust on people, on motivation and care in order
to make things easier.  The truth is key for understanding.

I would like to live in Colombia at least three 7 years more
at least, there are plenty of actions to be made in my 
country, this is why I have decided to move away from Bogot√°
as much as possible.
