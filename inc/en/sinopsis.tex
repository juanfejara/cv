In the same way I shared with various working groups involved in technology, either as developer, project manager or partner, leveraging synergies from different areas of knowledge and professions, in which I was successful when it came to producing high impact results. I have always characterized myself by simplifying every process in which I have been involved, often developing software for this purpose.
