\section{Abstract}

My main focus is on people and life, the motivation is key to make things
happen, always trying to place the best role for each one and aiming to
allow the team interact and solve problems, I am a puzzle solver and a 
builder of bridges based on trust. I had the opportunity to be school and
university teacher and also made the computers do what was needed to solve
problems in different scales with programming, I have been able to help
teams in the past to solve problems happily and also have learned from
previous failures avoiding to hit the same error.
