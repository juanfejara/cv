\section{Abstract}

During my career I have been fortunate to apply my knowledge on actuarial mathematics,
physics and technology making developments in many areas as was required, especially in
recent projects related with fintechs. In the same way I shared with various working groups
involved in technology, either as developer, project manager or partner, leveraging synergies
from different areas of knowledge and professions, in which I was successful when it came
to produce high impact results. I have always characterized myself by simplifying every
process in which I have been involved, often developing software for this purpose.
