I'm a software developer that loves the teamwork focused on achieving goals using architectures and evolving strategies to materialize ideas through products.  I'm able to communicate and integrate with people from product or other areas to get the things done in different scales, from ideas to systems that can handle hundreds of thousand of users.  I always love to learn and make sure I can share the experiences with the people I interact with.

\section{Computer related habilities}

I use Linux as operating system full tiem since 1999, I can work with
other unix flavored operating systems, my expertice on administration
includes X86, sparc and powerpc architectures, my base distribution is
Debian, in the past I have used RedHat and Suse.

\subsection{Developed software as OpenSource}
The software presented here is covered by GPL or is given to public
domain and can be donwloadable for free over the Internet, other
software products can be referenced as closed source and belong to
companies for whom I made them.

\begin{itemize}
\item GFPP : ``Flower Production Predictor''. Created and maintained a
  package used to predict the production of flowers for a
  farm. Developed in Java and tested on Linux and Windows. http://gfpp.sf.net
\item Gtypist : maintained for a short period a ``learning typing software''
\item gestiona : Software aimed to act as a white pages for school
  including students, workers and suppliers.  Part of the 
  Structio project http://structio.sf.net . Actually it's being
  developed, implemented in python and postgresql.
\item cuenta : At present, maintainer for this double entry account
  software that is subject to the colombian norms of accounting, and
  that shares the database with gestiona. Part of Structio  project
  http://structio.sf.net . It's on devel state. Implemented on
  PHP and postgresql.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Other contributions}
\label{sec:contrib}

I have done some minor contributions to some packages, translations and software products including Django, Openstreetmap, emacs, GNU project, Debian among others.

You can reach me as ikks at github, gitlab and bitbucket for some more bits of code.
